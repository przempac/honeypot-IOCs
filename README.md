# honeypot-IOCs
My repository is dedicated to gathering and sharing valuable information about honeypot indicators.

Honeypots play a crucial role in cybersecurity by acting as decoy systems that attract malicious actors and allow us to study their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

In this repository, you will find a comprehensive collection of honeypot indicators, including IP addresses, domain names, URLs, hashes, and other relevant data that can help identify and analyze potential threats. These indicators have been meticulously curated and verified by our expert team to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness.

By leveraging the power of community collaboration, we aim to create a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and security professionals to stay updated on the latest honeypot indicators and enhance their threat intelligence capabilities. We encourage active participation, including the submission of new indicators and the contribution of insights and analysis through issues and pull requests.

Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast, a seasoned professional, or simply curious about the world of honeypots, this repository is the perfect place to explore, learn, and share knowledge. Together, let's strengthen our defenses, outsmart adversaries, and make the digital world a safer place.

The project has started, you can already start observing the list of IOCs that will be updated regulary.

All steps of installing and configuring our honeypot were described in detail on our TokenZero blog here:
